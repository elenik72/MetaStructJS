## MetaStruct.Graph

`MetaStruct.Graph` - directed acyclic graph.

- [Graph Invariants](#graph-invariants)
- [Graph Creation](#graph-creation)

---

### Graph Invariants:

- has only one root node;
- has no non-connected nodes;
- has no cycles;
- has exit (at least one);

---

### Graph Creation

- create node `Graph.Node`:

```javascript
import Graph from 'MetaStruct'

Graph.Node.create(
  _your_uuid_, // autogenerated uuid by default
  _your_labels_, // [] by default
  _your_properties_ // {} by default
)
```

- create edge `Graph.Edge`:

```javascript
Graph.Edge.create(
  _your_left_node_, // an instance of Graph.Node
  _your_right_node_, // an instance of Graph.Node
  _your_labels_, // [] by default
  _your_properties_, // {} by default
  _your_weight_ // 0 by default
)
```

- build graph `Graph`:
  - fails on duplicated nodes (nodes with duplicated `uuid`s);
  - fails on duplicated edges (duplicated edge objects wich have identical left and right nodes);
  - fails on situation, when node has no edge entity (presented in edge list);
  - fails on situation, when edge has node which is not presented in node list;

```javascript
Graph.create(
  _your_array_of_nodes_, // [] by default
  _your_array_of_edges // [] by default
)
```

### Build and Development

- code style checking:

```
npm run lint
```

- development mode:

```
npm run start
```

- run tests:

```
npm run test // -- with using —Åoverage statement
```
